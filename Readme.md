# Noise Generation

This project aims to explore and to test several noise generation algorithms. So far, these algorithms are implemented :

## [Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise)

- [x] Perlin noise 1D - class PerlinNoise1D
- [x] Perlin noise 2D - class PerlinNoise2D
- [x] Perlin noise 3D - class PerlinNoise3D
- [ ] [Perlin noise with octaves](https://rtouti.github.io/graphics/perlin-noise-algorithm)

## [Worley noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worley_noise)

- [x] Worley noise - class WorneyNoise
- [ ] Worley noise 1D
- [ ] Worley noise 3D

## Simplex noise(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise)
- [ ] Simplex Noise 1D - In progress
- [ ] Simplex Noise 2D
- [ ] Simplex Noise 3D

# Next Steps :

- [ ] Unit tests and logging
- [ ] Code optimization
