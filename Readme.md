# Noise Generation

This project aims to explore and to test several noise generation algorithms. So far, these algorithms are implemented :
- [x] [Perlin noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) - class PerlinNoise
- [ ] [Perlin noise with octaves](https://rtouti.github.io/graphics/perlin-noise-algorithm)
- [x] [Worley noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worley_noise) - class WorneyNoise
- [ ] [Simplex Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_noise)


# Next Steps :
- [ ] Handle lower and higher dimension for noise generation
- [ ] Unit tests and logging
